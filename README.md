```lrc
[00:08.03] Just before the dawn
[00:10.14] When the light's still gone
[00:12.13] Shine, shine your way
[00:16.29] And you may not know, where to go
[00:20.29] Shine, shine your way
[00:30.79] 
[00:24.39] Open road but it's still dark
[00:26.36] Build a fire from a spark
[00:28.36] And shine, shine your way
[00:32.33] Feed the feeling in your heart
[00:34.54] Don't conceal it then you'll start
[00:36.44] To find, find your way
[00:47.44] 
[00:40.22] No one can stop, what has begun
[00:44.27] You must believe when I say
[00:57.77] 
[00:48.28] All of your tears will dry faster in the sun
[00:54.20] Starting today
[00:56.34] Shine, shine, shine
[00:59.80] Shine your way
[01:06.80] 
[01:08.37] There's an open sky
[01:10.26] And a reason why
[01:12.17] You shine, shine your way
[01:15.97] There's so much to learn
[01:18.23] And now it's your turn
[01:20.00] To shine, shine your way
[01:32.00] 
[01:24.13] There's a feeling deep inside
[01:26.30] You can let it be your guide
[01:28.32] To find, find your way
[01:32.13] There's no time for us to waste
[01:34.34] Got to take a leap of faith
[01:36.34] And fly, fly away
[01:44.84] 
[01:40.31] Don't have to walk
[01:42.46] Now you can run
[01:44.48] Nothing can get in your way
[01:57.98] 
[01:48.26] All of your tears will dry faster in the sun
[01:54.09] Starting today
[01:56.37] Shine, shine, shine
[01:59.85] Shine your way
[02:06.85] 
[02:08.49] Morning is breaking
[02:10.45] Darkness is fading
[02:12.42] We found a way to the light
[02:16.32] It's such a beautiful sight
[02:29.82] 
[02:22.38] Any time, anywhere
[02:24.47] Turn around and I'll be there
[02:26.44] To shine, shine your way
[02:38.44] 
[02:30.16] Like a star burning bright
[02:32.15] Lighting up the darkest night
[02:34.14] I'll shine, shine your way
[02:47.14] 
[02:38.30] Now I can see
[02:40.36] You are the one
[02:42.31] Sent here to show me the way
[02:56.31] 
[02:46.27] All of our tears will dry faster in the sun
[02:52.33] Starting today
[02:54.48] Shine, shine, shine
[02:56.41] We're on our way
[02:58.44] Shine, shine, shine
[03:00.42] That's what we say
[03:02.31] Shine, shine, shine
[03:06.06] Shine your way
[03:13.06] 
[03:08.86] There's a reason why
[03:10.25] You shine, shine your way
[03:22.75] 
[03:14.51] All of our tears will dry faster in the sun
[03:19.97] Shine your way
